# Week20-Challenge: Portfolio

## React

React was used to controll the html that was being loaded on to the pages.  It was also used to navagate between different pages without needing to create multiple html files.

### Componenets

Componenets were used to modularize the website and break up the different sections of html.  Some components are always loaded like the header and the footer but others are only loaded once a anchor tag was clicked in the nav bar resulting in a similar result to multiple html files.

## JSONS

JSON files were uesd store data for the website in a way that could easily be modified without having to dig through all of the code to make small changes.
